Fixing bugs on original site and creating an ERD diagram for the database
[Database ER diagram (dog-walking).pdf](https://github.com/tiffani-burk/deshawns-dog-walking/files/8950766/Database.ER.diagram.dog-walking.pdf)

Objective was to debug the boilerplate code and to display the assigment of dogs being walked, who they are being walked by and what city they are being walked in. The assigments displays on the page, based on the given database. My job was to create the logic to display the current assigments properly. <img width="1014" alt="Deshawns Dog Walking" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99150447/179362451-c34c62f3-b72e-4a47-b445-7959fe8ac52b.png">
